## dan_bot

In honour of the most prolific emojifier we have, this project serves to pay homage to one mans efforts to add banter through slack emojis even in the darkest corners of the most boring slack channels. Bringing you the classic favourites such as :joy: and :+1: as standard, `dan_bot` breaks the mould bringing the hits such as `squanchy`, :trollface: and `notsureif` on the regular.

This project uses a sample of roughly 5500 comments vectorized using TF-IDF to train a smallish, very overfitted, neural network. Other features include: the channel the message appeared in as well as the identity of the sender.

Full analysis and code can be found in the [notebook]('Basic\ Classifier.ipynb')
